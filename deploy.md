â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ game.js
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

## Troubleshooting

### Game Not Loading
- Check that all files are in the correct locations
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
- Verify all JavaScript files are in the `js/` folder

### Assets Not Loading
- The game uses procedural assets, so this shouldn't be an issue
- If you want to use image assets, make sure they're in the `assets/` folder

### CORS Errors
- GitHub Pages serves files over HTTPS, which should resolve CORS issues
- The game is designed to work without external assets

### Performance Issues
- The game is optimized for web browsers
- Should work well on most modern devices

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. In repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Enter your domain in the **Custom domain** field
3. Click **Save**
4. Configure your DNS settings with your domain provider

## Updating Your Game

To update your deployed game:

```bash
# Make your changes locally
# Then push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Update game with new features"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy your updated game.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the GitHub Pages documentation
2. Verify your file structure matches the requirements
3. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Open an issue in your repository
